A collection of notes, fairly cohesive, and reasonably comprehensive.

The primary purpose for which these notes were created was to teach myself by teaching to an imaginary listener. (Who is actually my future self, so you may find the pronoun usage extremely weird at times, but just roll with it.)
In the end, the notes turned out quite well, with some explanations comprehensive enough to get me back to speed even if I got amnesia. 
It's still a labour of love; most of it is not particularly designed to be usable by a 3rd party; if you can pardon its flaws that arise as a consequence, perhaps you may find some utility out of them too.
