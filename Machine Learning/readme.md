ML notes are presently incomplete. Commits are made with each new chapter, following the MLT coursework. The plan for the ML notes however, far exceeds this course. 
Predecessor notes of about 50 pages have been discarded due to its lack of vision, continuity, comprehensiveness and conciseness.
All ML content will soon be organised and dealt with in great depth in two as yet unnamed pdfs. The MLT pdf will become a part of these.
